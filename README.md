# Welcome to my dev test!

You can view deployed site at https://polar-forest-01221.herokuapp.com/

### Stuff I used

- Create React App
- Bootstrap
- Styled Components
- AOS (animate on scroll)

### View project locally

- clone repo
- `npm i`
- `npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):\*

1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

Styled Components: I love the ability to keep styling and components together, plus the option to write logic directly in the css.

React: I have a tendancy to jump to using React because of the many well maintained libraries, and powerful options to scale. If I had more time to refactor, I would split up the file into more components and use module.css file to organize the styling more.

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

Styled Componets may have been too complicated for this project. On a larger scale scale it's great because you can reuse components( i.e buttons, banners, logos), but for this one page project I actually found it start to become a hinderance. This was super css heavy, so I should of went with something to prioritize organizing of classes, etc.

3. What you enjoyed the most and why

Working on a project like this I always aquire small tricks to make styling faster and more responsive. This time around getting the four icons to align in a 2x2 grid I learned to use `flex: 1 0 50%`, neat!
